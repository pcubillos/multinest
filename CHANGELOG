Added initial set of C files:
- multinest.c (main, bridge to Python, function names need to change)
- random_ns.c (everything is alright in this file I believe)
- utils.c (LAPACK's extern void dsyevr is not working)
- kmeans.c (kmeans3 is working)

Solved issue with struct random_ns rand_ns global variable,
used as extern in kmeans (so far).

I think I got the source/header file structure sorted out.

Some testing is done (not yet in repo), a lot more needs to be tested

Fixed issue with LAPACK's dsyevr() functions, I should append an
underscore at the end of the function name.
utils.c is now working fine.

Added xmeans.c. At least anderson_darling() function is working.
